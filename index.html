            <h1 style=" text-align:center;font-family:'Ubuntu' ,sans-serif;">Why I Admire Him</h1>
            <p style=" text-align:center;font-family:'Ubuntu' ,sans-serif; padding:25px;">I was very young when his
                serial Pavitra
                Ristaa was on tv. My mother was a huge fan of the serial and
                enjoyed it. It was only because of Sushant's acting.
               He was so passionate and hardworker towards the film industry
                After that his films came and he gained popularity. He was said to be very humble and was a good actor.
                His acting skills are evident in MS Dhoni and Kedarnath.

                For the movie Detective Bymokesh Bakshy Sushant Singh Rajput stopped using electronic gadgets and etc as
                his movie was situated in the year 1942 . He changed his lifestyle and made as if he was living in 1942.
                It also gave him many losses because since his phone would be off most of the time he would miss many
                calls for major parties and etc, but he never bothered about these things.
                Honestly I was shocked when I came to know about his death. My mother, being a huge fan of his, is still
                very sad. She believed that one day he would become a highly successful actor.

                So, Sushant's acting and his humble behaviour made me like him.

                Hope his soul rests in peace.
